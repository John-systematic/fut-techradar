However, these IP addresses frequently churn in dynamic microservices environments. By leveraging Linux eBPF, Cilium provides API-aware networking and security by transparently inserting security in a way that is based on service, pod or container identity in contrast to IP address identification. By decoupling security from addressing, Cilium could play a significant role as a new network protection layer and we recommend you to check it out."
